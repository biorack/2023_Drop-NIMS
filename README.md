A combinatorial droplet microfluidic device integrated with mass spectrometry for enzyme screening - Data repository

"The supplementary data presented here is from “A combinatorial droplet microfluidic device integrated with mass spectrometry for enzyme screening” published in "Lab on a Chip". It includes detailed instructions on the construction of the microfluidics platform (Figure S1), a demonstration of the combined microfluidics and NIMS platform with NIMS-tagged cellobiose (G2) and verapamil (Figure S2), chemical structures of NIMS-tagged substrates (Figure S3), specific products formed from enzymatic reactions shown in Figure 3 (Figure 3 shows the sum of the products while Figure S4 shows the individual products), chemical structures of the mass barcodes (Figure S5), an analysis of the cross-contamination between sample spots (Figure S6), and the numbers of replicates and a count of the number of droplets per sample spot (Figure S7). Descriptions of and links to the supplementary tables are also included. Supplementary tables S1-6 provide the raw data, the possible combinations of droplets, and the numbers of replicates for Chip 1 (Tables S1-3; summary data are in Figures 3a-c) and Chip 2 (Tables S4-S6; summary data are in Figures 3d-e)."
